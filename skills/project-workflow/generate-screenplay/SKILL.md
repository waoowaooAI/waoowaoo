# Generate Screenplay

## Purpose

Transform ordered clip units into validated screenplay output clip by clip. This skill is the final step of the `story-to-script` workflow and produces the structured screenplay artifact consumed by storyboard generation.

## Use This Skill When

- `clip.split` exists and is current.
- The workflow needs screenplay scenes suitable for storyboard planning.
- Story text or upstream analyses changed and screenplay must be regenerated cleanly.

## Do Not Use This Skill When

- Clip splitting has not completed successfully.
- The caller needs clip segmentation rather than screenplay content.
- Downstream storyboard regeneration is the only intended change and screenplay is already valid.

## Inputs

- `clip.split`
- Upstream analysis context derived from characters, locations, and props
- Skill-owned prompt files selected by locale

## Outputs

- Structured screenplay scenes for each clip.
- Persistable screenplay payload for the `clip.screenplay` artifact.
- UI summary describing total clips, successes, failures, and scene count.

## Artifact Contract

- Reads: `clip.split`
- Writes: `clip.screenplay`
- May invalidate downstream storyboard and voice artifacts.

## Execution Rules

- Must run after `split-clips`.
- Process clips in clip order and preserve stable identifiers.
- Report clip-level failures explicitly.
- Never silently skip failed clips or backfill fake screenplay content.

## Failure Conditions

- `clip.split` is missing or invalid.
- A clip cannot be turned into schema-valid screenplay JSON.
- The aggregate result leaves unresolved failed clips.
- Output scenes do not preserve clip order or required identifiers.

## Quality Bar

- Every screenplay unit must remain grounded in the original clip content.
- Output must be valid structured data, not freeform prose.
- Failures must be visible so the workflow stops before invalid storyboard generation begins.
